# This is what's known as the "Entry Point" page for the Streamlit app. It provides an 
# overview of the dashboard, its purpose, and the data source. It also sets up the page
# configuration and title. The scripts in the "pages" folder contain the subsequent pages
# of the dashboard, which are accessible via the sidebar navigation in Streamlit.

# I used ChatGPT-5.1, Copilot, and Streamlit's documentation to help write this code, so I'll
# narrate this code to explain its functionality and purpose.

    ### Dashboard Overview

    This dashboard provides an interactive exploration of the aerial bombing campaigns during the Vietnam War (1964-1973). It's divided into two pages, each focusing on a different aspect of the bombing data:

    1. **Descriptive Statistics**: offers a comprehensive overview of the bombing data, including key statistics, trends over time, geographical distributions of targets, and the military services involved
    2. **Predictive Modeling**: presents a Random Forest model that predicts mission outcomes based on various features of the bombing missions

    Navigate through the pages using the sidebar to explore different facets of the Vietnam War aerial bombing data. Feel free to interact with the visualizations and ask the dashboard's AI assistant at the bottom of each page to gain insights into the historical context of the conflict.

    ### Data Source
    The data used in this dashboard is sourced from the Theater History of Operations Reports (THOR) [Vietnam War Bombing Operations dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usaf/vietnam-war-bombing-operations?select=THOR_Vietnam_Bombing_Operations.csv), which provides:
    - A bombing operation .csv file which contains each mission’s 5Ws
    - An aircraft glossary explaining the models of U.S. aircraft used during Vietnam War
    - A glossary of munitions used by the aircraft
    - An explanatory dictionary for THOR data

# LLM HELPER FUNCTIONS
# --------------------------------------

# After the user inputs the filter parameters (i.e. start/end year, aircraft, etc.), 
# under the hood the dashboard has a Polars df with the returned query dat. We can give 
# the LLM summary stats or small samples of this df to help it answer questions. We can 
# feed some of this df (i.e. small samples of rows to show patterns, summary stats, etc.)
# plus the user's questions to the LLM as context to the model to produce better answers.

    You are an assistant helping a user explore a dataset of Vietnam War bombing missions. 
    The user is interacting with a multi-page Streamlit dashboard that filters the data by year and
    aircraft type. The user is currently on the INTRO PAGE of the dashboard, and they may ask
    questions about the Vietnam War, aerial bombing campaigns, or the dataset itself. The dataset was
    sourced from the Theater History of Operations Reports (THOR) Vietnam War Bombing Operations dataset on 
    Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usaf/vietnam-war-bombing-operations?select=THOR_Vietnam_Bombing_Operations.csv).

    When you answer:
    - Speak **directly to the user** in a natural, conversational tone.
    - Use the second persion ("you") and past tense where appropriate.
    - Do **not** describe what you are about to do.
    - Do **not** say things like "we need to respond to the user" or "the assistant should".
    - Just give the final answer, as if you were chatting with the user.

    Use general knowledge of the Vietnam War to answer the user's questions about the general context of the Vietnam
    War or the dataset. If you don't have enough information to be precise, say so explicitly. Do NOT make up exact 
    numeric values that aren't implied by the summary above. If the user asks for specific statistics or data points 
    from the dataset, politely inform them that you don't have access to the data on this page, and 
    suggest they navigate to the Descriptive Statistics page before providing any other contextual information. 
    The Predictive Modeling page contains a Random Forest model that predicts mission outcomes based on various 
    features of the bombing missions dataset.
